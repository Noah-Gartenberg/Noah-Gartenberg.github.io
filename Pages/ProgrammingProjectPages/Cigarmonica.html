        <section id="Purpose">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <ul class="BulletPoints">
                <li>This was a group effort by my college's Game Design Club</li>
                <li>Our goal was to make a simple game over the course of a few weeks. It went into the next month due to the nature of that spring semester.</li>
                <li>I wound up the main programmer: I programmed the dialogue, movement, timer, and camera systems.</li>
                <li>I had not expected to shoulder so much of the game's programming, but I it was my first actual expereince with the "wiring everything together" aspect of this field that I've come to enjoy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <a class="anchor" id="DialogueSystemAnchor"></a>
        <section id="DialogueSystem">
            <h4>Dialogue System</h4>
            <ul class="BulletPoints">
                <li>The dialogue system was designed to facilitate interactions between players and NPCs.</li>
                <li>I worked with our writers (of which I was one myself) to try to make our goals possible.</li>
                <li>I implemented a proto-bytecode of sorts (though I didn't know the meaning of that word).</li>
                
                
                <h5>How it works</h5>
                <li>The dialogue lines exist as scriptable objects in Unity. Each character stores a list of dialogue lines, that can be randomized or played in order.</li>
                <ul class="BulletPoints">
                    <li>When the play dialogue method is called, a reference to the specific line of dialogue is passed in.</li>
                    <li>the dialogue runs by listening for user clicks to advance to the next line. Dialogue runs until a line only contains "END DIALOGUE"</li>
                    <li>To make the sort of proto-bytecode work, before displaying dialogue, the dialogue manager parses the dialogue string, and if it starts with "COMMANDS," then that line isn't displayed, and functionality is carried out.</li>
                    <li>With these commands, the dialogue manager can: play sound, make things appear or disappear on screen, wait [x] time, and "trade" an object</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <a class="anchor" id="OtherSystemsAnchor"></a>
        <section id="OtherSystems">
            <h4>Other Systems</h4>
            <ul class="BulletPoints">
                <li>The movement system is a simple point and click system. The major issues it has come from my failure to make affordances clear, and that it is not a true pathfinding system.</li>
                <li>The camera system changes the player's camera angle and camera they see through when the player enters a trigger collider</li>
                <li>While the player is moving, the camera turns towards the player, so players don't have a ton of dead spots in their vision, without needing control over the camera</li>
                <li>I also worked on the timer system, though that was a joint effort between one other person and I; the biggest issue was figuring out how to make the timer pause when the player interacts with NPCs</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="WhatILearned">
            <h4>What I learned</h4>
            <ul class="BulletPoints">
                <li>I gained a vastly improved understanding of Unity and even learned some programming concepts through my work on each of these systems</li>
                <li>For example, I learned about Scriptable Objects, Coroutines, and the Singleton programming pattern</li>
                <li>How to set realistic expectations for what I could program when working with other sub-teams</li>
                <li>What I could promise and deliver upon in a quick time frame</li>
                <li>How to reuse code to meet the needs of other sub-teams, rather than making everything from scratch; the dialogue system did the majority of the functionality in the game.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h4>What I Would Do Differently, From 2 Years Later</h4>
            <ul class="BulletPoints">
                <li>I would properly document the dialogue system, and explain how it works so that others could work with it when I wasn't there:</li>
                <ul class="BulletPoints">
                    <li>This could have been as simple as a shared google doc with a table filled with columns for class,method name, explanation, parameters, return values, and requirements</li>
                    <li>I would also explain how to make new commands, as that was one of the issues we ran into late in development when I wasn't able to be there.</li>
                    <li>I could have done something similar for the commands system too, such as "command name, what it does, what parameters it takes"</li>
                </ul>
                <li>I would have ensured that affordances are properly conveyed, as right now, that is not done.</li>
                <li>To ensure that the affordances fit with the aesthetics of the game, I would likely have used a panel to display a character's name at the top when the mouse hovers over them.</li>
                <li>I would have implemented the actual point and click movement with an actual navmesh, since that would only need to be baked once for this game.</li>
            </ul>

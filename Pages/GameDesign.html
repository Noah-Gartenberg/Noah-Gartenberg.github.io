                 <ul class="BulletPoints hideBulletPoints">
                    <li>I created an armor (specifically geared towards the wild-magic sorcerer subclass, and specifically made for characters at least level 4) that allows players to nullify one instance of damage per short rest by triggering a wild magic surge</li>
                    <li>I designed the wild magic surges to be extremely situational in terms of use; Some surges will enable or disable mobility, or cause players to take more or less damage, or enable or disable enemies</li>
                    <li>I originally inteded for this mod to be simple so I could focus on learning to make mods; it would have functioned the same, but instead triggered one of the normal wild magic surges, instead of my custom surges;  upon playtesting, I found that this lessened the novelty of those magic surges, and created some custom ones to maintain the novelty the vanilla wild magic surges bring to the game</li>
                    <li>The Wild Magic Sorcery subclass causes all spells cast by a sorcerer to have a chance of triggering a random "wild magic surge," which can make any combat encounter chaotic and more novel than it was previously</li>

                    <li>For this game, I worked with the rest of the Game Design Club at my college</li>
                    <li>We all worked together to design the game, I then helped write some of the NPC dialogue (particularly level 3), programmed many of the game's systems, and implemented the game into Unity</li>
                    <li>We designed a simple gameplay loop of players being given an item (normally in the previous level), and having to figure out whom to give it to by interacting with the NPCs</li>
                    <li>Only by giving the correct NPC their corresponding item, could players be able to progress, eventually find out what happens to Llewyllyn, and escape the prison</li>

                    <li><h4>Purpose</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>I made an armor intended to be worn by a wild-magic sorcerer who is level 4 or higher</li>
                        <li>This armor stops fewer hits than other armors in the game at that point, but allows players to nullify one instance of damage per short rest by triggering a wild magic surge</li>
                        <li>I made 20 custom wild magic surges for the effects that could be triggered by this armor by remixing assets that were already in the game</li>
                        <li>I used this project to learn how to make mods for Baldur's Gate 3, ironically, right before the modders toolkit was released</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Design Philosophy</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>I designed the wild magic surges to be situational, with the potential to either doom or save a character in danger</li>
                        <li>Some were designed to affect mobility or chance to hit of all creatures nearby</li>
                        <li>Others immobilize or completely remove creatures from a fight</li>
                        <li>There were even a few that did nothing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>How the Project Changed</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>This armor was originally supposed to be simple: it would have only triggered the vanilla wild magic surges</li>
                        <li>While playtesting, I realized this approach dampened the novelty of playing as the wild magic related subclasses, diminishing overall fun</li>
                        <li>To fix this, I remixed pre-existing assets and stats (the way in which abilities like spells were made) to create 20 new surges</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Context</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>Wild magic surges normally trigger when characters of specific subclasses use certain abilities (ex: wild magic sorcerers and their spellcasting)</li>
                        <li>These subclasses create chaotic experiences, as you never know if you will turn yourself blue, explode everything, or if nothing will happen</li>
                    </ul>
                 </ul>

                <ul class="BulletPoints hideBulletPoints">
                    <li><h4>Purpose</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>This was a group effort by my college's Game Design Club</li>
                        <li>Our goal was to make a simple game over the course of a few weeks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Design Philosophy/Design Work</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints" >
                        <li>We designed a simple gameplay loop, where players are given items to trade with specific NPCs</li>
                        <li>We wanted players to have to walk around and interact with NPCs, and have the choice of whether or not to trade with that NPC</li>
                        <li>This would help players progress through the game and its story to ultimately escape prison before they're executed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>My Personal Contributions</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>I wrote NPC lines (especially for level 3), with the goal of giving obvious hints as to the identity of the NPC to trade with for that level, or obvious red herrings</li>
                        <li>I designed the game's movement, dialogue, and camera systems to fit our needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>What I Learned</h4></li>
                    <ul class="BulletPoints">
                        <li>How to set realistic expectations for what I could program when working with other sub-teams</li>
                        <li>What I could promise and deliver upon in a quick time frame</li>
                        <li>How to reuse code to meet the needs of other sub-teams, rather than making everything from scratch</li>
                    </ul>

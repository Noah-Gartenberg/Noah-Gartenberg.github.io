            <h3>Cigarmonica</a> - Game Design Club Group Project (<a href="https://albino-penguin.itch.io/cigarmonica" class="PageLink"><i>Link</i></a>)- 6 downloads</h3>

                    <li>For this game, I worked with the rest of the Game Design Club at my college</li>
                    <li>We all worked together to design the game, I then helped write some of the NPC dialogue (particularly level 3), programmed many of the game's systems, and implemented the game into Unity</li>
                    <li>We designed a simple gameplay loop of players being given an item (normally in the previous level), and having to figure out whom to give it to by interacting with the NPCs</li>
                    <li>Only by giving the correct NPC their corresponding item, could players be able to progress, eventually find out what happens to Llewyllyn, and escape the prison</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Games I made during Game Jams - MicroJam Game Submissions (<a href="https://itch.io/c/4828693/game-jam-games-i-have-made" class="PageLink"><i>Link</i></a>)</h3>
            <ul class="BulletPoints hideBulletPoints">
                <li>For these games, I worked by myself as I was unable to find people I felt comfortable working with.</li>
                <li>I had 2 days for each of these games to make a functioning video game that met the theme (which I knew before the jam started) and the prerequisite (which was revealed at the start of the jam), both of which would impact how I made the games.</li>
                <li>I used these game jams as opportunities to get better at using various programming patterns I had recently learned about (like Singletons, Observers, and Composition), in addition to me challenging myself at times to figure out how game developers make things like notes in video games.</li>
                <li>Although none of these games ever won, I noticed a massive growth in the code I wrote, as it changed from being heavily coupled code during my first game jam, to being largely modulable.</li>
                <li>I also gained a better understanding of how long it takes for me to make things (specifically when I have pressure outside myself being applied), and as a result, my games were able to become more polished within largely the same amounts of time required</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reading Ruler Firefox Plugin - Personal Project (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reading-ruler-plug-in/" class = "PageLink"><i>Link</i></a>)</h3>
            <ul class="BulletPoints hideBulletPoints">
                <li>After struggling to read what I felt was a particularly poorly formatted article for a class, I sought to find a reading ruler plug in, but couldn't find any (I didn't know they were called add-ons, and not extensions, on firefox)</li>
                <li>I decided to fix this problem by making myself a reading ruler plug in for Firefox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>I figured out how to make a reading ruler that obscured all text outside an adjustable area.</li>
                <li>This project took me about a month to get working, with a several month gap between first getting the ruler to work, and actually publishing it, as to be honest, I kind of forgot I'd been working on it as I was using all my spare time on it; spare time towards the end of the month that I rapidly started to lose.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My Portfolio Website</h3>
            <ul class="BulletPoints hideBulletPoints">
                <li>I designed and made this website from scratch, which is likely clear if you look at it.</li>
                <li>The creation of this website overall has taken me two months, with a one month gap due to college starting again and the high workloads that came with it.</li>
                <li>I am aware that this isn't really that impressive, but I'm hoping to have more examples besides this one in the future, or to make this more impressive.</li>
                <li>I was originally intending to just use a template, but I got overwhelmed when looking through the code, and didn't feel I could adjust it to suit my needs in a way that wouldn't be extremely clear.</li>
                <li>Also, I have been meaning to refresh my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a while now -- it wasn't gone, but I don't have many opportunities to use it</li>

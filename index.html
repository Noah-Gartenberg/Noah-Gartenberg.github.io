                <!-- The goal of this section is to say who I am, I'm thinking 3-4 sentences at most, probably closer to 2-3, and to 
                 describe my goals in life and in my career, and the sort of things I make my work off of-->
                 <!-- I'd also like to have a a fun facts section in here or something like that just to get more of my personality across-->
                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>I am a highly motivated Sophmore in College at Elon University, currently double majoring in
                    Computer Science and English with a Concentration in Creative Writing with a minor in Game Design.
                    I'm interested in each of these areas, as seperately they are their own unique puzzles to give my brain
                    the stimulation and engagement it needs. Together, in video games, it's like a never ending puzzle for me to solve, 
                    and I love video games for providing me this never-ending stimulation and activity. If I ever get bored or tired of one area,
                    I can try to switch to another or focus on another. Similarly, I can use each field as a hobby while I'm focusing on one as my occupation.

                <!-- This section will explain why my portfolio has so many different pages, and why I have so many different interests, and 
                 kind of why I can't really just separate them from myself-->
                 <h2>Why is my portfolio structured in this way</h2>
                 <p>My portfolio is structured in this way to make navigation 
                    and editing my portfolio(s) as easy as possible for myself.
                    When I have multiple things in lots of different places, I
                    tend to struggle to get things done. To make finding things easy,
                    I will be breaking down what is on each portfolio at the top of each page.

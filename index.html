                  <img src="images\PictureOfMe.png" style="width:10%; float:left; display: block;"/>
                  <p style="float:left; display:block;">I am a highly motivated Honors Fellow at Elon University, currently on track for a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in English with a concentration in Creative Writing and a Minor in Game Design. 
                    I chose to focus on these subjects because, separately, each presents unique puzzles to give me the stimulation and engagement I need. 
                    I like the idea of being able to put them together and apply my creativity and coding and writing skills to create challenges and puzzles for others to solve through my games. <br><br>
                    I have also gained a fondness for communicating and collaborating with others, and especially for teaching others. 
                    This came about from my time as a karate instructor (I am also a fourth degree black belt), from my time as a teacher’s assistant for a second level course for Computer Science, and from my time playing Dungeons and Dragons. <br><br>
                    When not working on personal projects, I can often be found at Game Design Club meetings, writing for my college’s sketch show, with my dungeons and dragons group (for which I will be the dungeon master of a campaign soon), 
                    and assisting my Game Design professor with research on how VR games can be used by the Doctor of Physical Therapy program to improve patient outcomes.
